            <p>Hello! my name is Lindsey Boj and Im from Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. I am a student
                at
                the BYU-Idaho University, Im studying Software Development, I really enjoy it, Im a
                member of the church of Jesus Christ and I also
                like
                to play instruments, my favorite is the violin, I can play drums, trasverse flute
                and
                violin. I like to sing and with my brothers we have a strings and singing group, I
                am
                the oldest and
                the most short of our group, that is fun because always people think that Im the
                youngest, but I like that they think that. When I was 5 years old I remember that I
                join
                to a choir and since that time I realize that I love to sing, I was really shy and
                affraid at the beguining, but now each time that we have a concert it makes me
                happy,
                even if sometimes my hands tremble a little bit because of the nerves it helps me to
                make better the vibrato in the violin. We want to some day become more profetionals
                in
                our instruments and to make our own songs and music. This year one of the first of
                our
                goals is to make our first song, and well we are writting a song that my mom
                compose,
                she is really good in that and she is happy that we are using one of her songs as
                our
                first, and I'm so exiting for that,
                really love music.</p>
