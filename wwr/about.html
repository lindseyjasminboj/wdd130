                <p> Our team members report a high sense of fulfillment derived from mastering the
                    elements and leading
                    others through challenges. The "office" is a breathtaking canyon, and the
                    "meetings" are high-fives
                    after a successful drop. This connection to nature and the tight-knit
                    camaraderie among the crew
                    creates a workplace where laughter is as constant as the current.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Ten years ago, a group of river guides led by a man named Elias founded White
                        Water Rafting. Based
                        in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the company started with just three
                        rafts and a passion for the
                        Class IV rapids of the "The Pathway".</p>
                </li>
                <li><img src="images/rafting.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>
                    <p>For years, the business was simple. Customers would walk up to the wooden
                        shack by the river, sign a
                        paper waiver, and pay in cash. Elias kept track of the schedule in a large,
                        coffee-stained notebook.
                        If the sun was shining and the water was high, it was a good day.</p>
